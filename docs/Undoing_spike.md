# Strategies for Undoing in Git

The "Git Undoing" functionality allows users to reverse changes in a repository. It offers several methods to undo commits or changes depending on the situation, such as restoring previous versions of files, uncommitting changes, or discarding modifications. Each undo command serves a specific purpose, ensuring flexibility and control over the repository's history.

Git provides several powerful commands for undoing changes, each designed for specific scenarios. Choosing the right strategy depends on whether you're dealing with **untracked files**, **staged changes**, or **committed changes**, as well as whether you want to **rewrite history** or simply **reverse changes**. Below are the key undo commands—`git checkout`, `git reset`, `git revert`, and `git clean`—and when you should use each.
