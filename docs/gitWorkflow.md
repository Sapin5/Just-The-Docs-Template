# Why git?
{: .no_toc }

With Git we can undo almost anything.
The Usual Three Ways of Undo:
- Checkout (Slightly Dangerous)
- Reset (Destructive)
- Revert (Safe)

## Why not just use Ctrl + Z

CTRL-Z lets us undo changes in files we have open,
but it has limitations:
- What if you wanted to undo a change to a file
you made weeks ago?
- What if you wanted to undo a change made to a
file by someone else?
- What if you wanted to experiment with a series
of changes and then revert back to a specific
version of the file?

## More Than Just Undo
Version control allows for more than just undoing things:
- Work on new projects features while at the same time patching bugs found in older
version of the code.
- Collaborate with someone on a projects without overwriting each other's work.
- Work with distributed teams of coders from around the world to develop open-
source applications.
