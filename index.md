## What is _Version Control_?
Version control software keeps track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database.
If a mistake is made, developers can turn back the clock and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake while minimizing disruption to all team members.


## What is _Git_?

By far, the most widely used modern version control system in the world today is Git. Git is a mature, actively maintained open source project originally developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, the famous creator of the Linux operating system kernel.

Pros of using Git:
 - It's really quick
 - Local commits rock
 - Quick to start a new repository (no configuration etc)
 - github is easy to use

Cons of using Git:
 - Lack of IDE and Explorer integration
 - Cannot checkout a part of the repository
 - Does not track empty folders
 - Bad Windows support
